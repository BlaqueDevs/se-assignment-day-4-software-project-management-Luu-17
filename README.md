# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management

## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Ensuring timely delivery is crucial because it will make the stakeholder happy, as per scope and this may create a good repuation for 
the project manager enabling him to have future projects with a client, to ensure that a PM meets their deadlines they do need to continously visit their scope and schedule plan and also have stand up meetings with their teams to enusre that time is tracked well and used effeciently.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Cost control ensure that money is disributed well and within budget during a project, it is always important for a project to always stay within budget to avoide extra and unnecessary cost. A way to prevent project over runs is to properly plan and have a realistic estimate of how much it be to get the project running from beginning to end.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Even though these waterfall and agile are both guides to the software development process they follow very different approaches when it comes to building a software. The Waterfall follows a much linear and sequential appraoch where one phase must be completed before the other phase can get started, the advantage of a waterfall is it is predictable however it cannot adapt to change. The agile methodology follows a much flexible aproach which can also be good in responding to change, agile is a focuses on a collaborative were small and repetetive updates are done in the devolopment process, its disadnantage is scope creeping as the stakeholders can require things that arent even the the project as you are directly in contact with them

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Building a social media platform, this software requres quite a few componentsnot only in design but also in which waterfal may not be suitable for, for example how facebook started introducing a video section to their platform and after tik tok boomed the video section became vertical and was called reels, this was a way to adapt to changes not onyl within the app but also consumer trends. 
Building an a clock software this does not requre new section within the softwar as the basic section of a clock softwer is timer, alarm and the watch.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Software Testing and code reviews, it is important because a software wont be used by software engineers but rather consumers, and that us the purpose of why it is being built so it can be used, therefore consumers need to recieve a software tha is smooth and doesnt have defects otherwise it may be a bad softare and also is a build reputation for the team.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining a scope can help with identifying how much time will certain requirements need and putting all the other requirementsz together can thus give an esitimate of how long the project will take to be done.  A WBS is the step-by-step process of a project, from beginnign to end, including design & reqiuerement phase, it is the process used and created after the scope of a project has been define a path for the project from start to finish to be planned and followed.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
A detailed schedule can help the project team know what their a busy with and what will be next and when in a given time, this helps with knpwing if the project is on time and and far it is to finish 

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
My software aims to address gangsterism in my community, as a lot of teenagers and youngsters are inspired by gangsters within the community due to flashy material.
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
It can help as to knowing what the software need to do in order to function and solve the given issue.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
The software can actually find extra murals for children and youth saving them the time to be doing research, this way it can be easier for a child to do what they enjoy instead of joining gangs because the dont have access to actvities they enjoy. 

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
It finds extra murals for your child according to the details you have put for them helping them find fitting activites the can partake on and enjoy.

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?


## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
